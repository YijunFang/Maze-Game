Getting data from gameRep
    * Query maze for locations of specific features, will be doing:
        * Get Maze walls
        * Get Coin locations
        * Get Starting and ending locations
    * Regularly query location of player (get player location)
    * Regularly query score and time. (get player score, get player time)

Rendering
    * Using maze data, create graphical representation of maze 
        * Still figuring out how to do this 
    * Place player and coin sprites on the maze
        * Set player location to specific grid location
        * Set coin sprites to specific grid locations
    * Regularly update the render when new events occur
        * Call an update method that updates the locations of all
            objects graphically
    
Input
    * Pass input from player to the gameRep
        * Set player location using WASD or arrow keys.
        * Get hint paths (i.e. get some grid references to highlight)
        * Display hint path if hint button is triggered 
    * If player steps on a coin, trigger an update to the coin counter
        * i.e. if player is on coin: remove coin
        * increment coin counter
    * Immediately call a render update after this input.
