• So far, we have completed our overall plan and some of our screen designs.
• Today, we determined the criteria for the size & difficulty of the maze:
o  Length, width.
o  Number of coins
o Points awarded on time finish can be calculated using e^-x curve
• We also need to:
o Implement prototype screens with Swing.
o  Implement MazeRep (representation of our maze)
o  Implement algorithm to generate our mazw
• Problems we need to overcome so far:
o Finding time to do the project as other course assignments are getting in the way.
• For the scope of our project, we have decided on:
o  The criteria of our maze difficulty will be:
• Size
• Number of coins
o The user's performance in the maze will be measured using points, which is calculated by:
• Difficulty
• Number of coins the user has left
• Time it took to complete the maze (calculated using e^-x, x = time)
o  Use randomised recursive depth first search for maze generation

• For the design of the project, we have largely completed our screen design, and John Luo has created the first iteration of the Maze interface.
•  For the planning of the project, we have allocated the following tasks:
o  Implementation of prototype screens with Swing
• MainMenu – Weilon
• NewGame - Weilon
• Maze - Angela
• EndGame - Teresa
• Help - Selena
o Implement MazeRep
o Implement Maze generation algorithm
o Link the prototype screens together
