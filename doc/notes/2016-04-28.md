- So far, we have completed our overall plan and some of our screen designs.
- Today, we determined the criteria for the size & difficulty of the maze:
	-  Length, width.
	-  Number of coins
	- Points awarded on time finish can be calculated using e^-x curve
- We also need to:
	- Implement prototype screens with Swing.
	-  Implement MazeRep (representation of our maze)
	-  Implement algorithm to generate our mazw
- Problems we need to overcome so far:
	- Finding time to do the project as other course assignments are getting in the way.
- For the scope of our project, we have decided on:
	-  The criteria of our maze difficulty will be:
		- Size
		- Number of coins
- The user's performance in the maze will be measured using points, which is calculated by:
	- Difficulty
	- Number of coins the user has left
	- Time it took to complete the maze (calculated using e^-x, x = time)
-  Use randomised recursive depth first search for maze generation

- For the design of the project, we have largely completed our screen design, and John Luo has created the first iteration of the Maze interface.
-  For the planning of the project, we have allocated the following tasks:
	-  Implementation of prototype screens with Swing
		- MainMenu – Weilon
		- NewGame - Weilon
		- Maze - Angela
		- EndGame - Teresa
		- Help - Selena
	- Implement MazeRep
	- Implement Maze generation algorithm
	- Link the prototype screens together
